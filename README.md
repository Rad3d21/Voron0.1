Made some modifications to existing usermods.
First the tall feet for the skirtmod by doubletrouble. Added the filament guide. Also added buttons and changed backplate of display.

The hinge by MSiemons was changed so the tophat can easily be taken off or hinged backward. Changed just the lower parts not the tophat part.

Made a handle to pickup based on the doorhandle of the original design. Should go on like this one by Ch4rlesB https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/tree/master/printer_mods/Ch4rlesB/V0_Handles_Slim
