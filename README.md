The hinge by MSiemons was changed so the tophat can easily be taken off or hinged backward. Changed just the lower parts not the tophat part.

Made a handle to pickup based on the doorhandle of the original design. Should go on like this one by Ch4rlesB https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/tree/master/printer_mods/Ch4rlesB/V0_Handles_Slim

Ziptie/tie-wrap brackets that push in and twist to lock. Holes in 2 directions for perpendicular or parallel fixing of cables.

Modifications to oldfar-t sideswipe (https://github.com/oldfar-t/Side-Swipe-Magnetic-Probe). The lip did not fit and added ADXL moount plus enlarged the holes for the magnets. Thinking of maybe adding brush for nozzle cleanup. Could be added to the arm.
