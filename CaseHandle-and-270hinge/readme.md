A handle to pickup the v0 that was modelled like the door handle.
Printed with solid modifier around the outer holes and 15% infill.

Made a doorstopper to push and twist into the exstrusion under tht door to keep it from hanging down.

270 hinge that makes it possible to fold the door to the side of the printer and clear the handles.
A doorcatch to hold it in place.
I have magnets in both the plexiglass and the handle so the handle can be taken off.
